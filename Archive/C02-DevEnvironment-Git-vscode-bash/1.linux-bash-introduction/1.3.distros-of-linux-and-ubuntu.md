# TUTORIAL: Create a python program using only shell commands

Here is a tutorial on creating a folder, writing a simple Python program, running it via the terminal, and some use cases for practice:

  - [Use Cases for Practice](#use-cases-for-practice)

The terminal provides a quick way to write and execute Python code without needing a full IDE. Let's go through an example workflow:

## Creating a Project Folder

First, we'll make a folder for our Python program using `mkdir`:

```bash
mkdir my_python_program
cd my_python_program
```

This creates a folder called `my_python_program` and moves us inside it.

## Writing a Simple Python Program

Next, we'll write a simple Python script called `hello.py` using the `nano` text editor in the terminal:

```bash 
nano hello.py
```

Inside `nano`, let's add the following code and save the file:

```python
print("Hello World from Python!")
```

This script prints a hello world message when run.

## Running the Python Program

We can now execute our Python script using:  

```bash
python3 hello.py
```

We should see "Hello World from Python!" printed.

And that's it! We created and ran a Python program entirely from the terminal.

## Use Cases for Practice

Here are some ideas you can try to practice these concepts:

- Write a Python script that performs math operations 
- Create a simple Mad Libs game that takes user input 
- Fetch and process data from a web API like OpenWeatherMap  
- Automate folder and file cleanup using Python

The key takeaway is that the terminal allows quickly testing and running Python code without needing a full-fledged IDE (we will cover the VSCode IDE in this class). Feel free to explore more use cases!
