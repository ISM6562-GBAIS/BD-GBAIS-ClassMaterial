# Git Tutorial: Branching, Committing, and Merging

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to manage multiple branches in Git. We'll cover creating a development branch, committing to it, switching back to the main branch for a quick fix, returning to the development branch, and finally merging the development branch into the main branch.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Git installed and a repository (local or cloned from GitHub) to work with.

## Step 1: Creating a Development Branch

### 1. Check Your Current Branch

First, make sure you're on the main branch.

```bash
git branch
```

The branch with an asterisk (*) next to it is your current branch.

### 2. Create and Switch to the Development Branch

Create a new branch named `development` and switch to it.

```bash
git checkout -b development
```

This command creates the `development` branch and checks it out in one step.

## Step 2: Committing to the Development Branch

### 1. Make Changes

Edit or add files in your project as needed.

### 2. Stage Your Changes

Add your changes to the staging area.

```bash
git add .
```

### 3. Commit Your Changes

Commit your changes with a message.

```bash
git commit -m "Your detailed commit message"
```

Repeat steps 1 to 3 as many times as necessary for your development work.

## Step 3: Switching Back to the Main Branch for a Quick Fix

### 1. Switch to the Main Branch

```bash
git checkout main
```

### 2. Make Your Quick Fix

Edit the necessary files for your fix.

### 3. Stage and Commit the Fix

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Quick fix"
```

## Step 4: Returning to the Development Branch

### 1. Switch Back to the Development Branch

```bash
git checkout development
```

### 2. Continue Development

Make any additional changes if needed, and commit them.

## Step 5: Merging the Development Branch into Main

### 1. Switch to the Main Branch

```bash
git checkout main
```

### 2. Merge the Development Branch

Merge the changes from `development` into `main`.

```bash
git merge development
```

If there are no conflicts, the merge will be successful. If there are conflicts, you'll need to resolve them manually.

### 3. Push Changes (Optional)

If you're working with a remote repository, push your changes to update the remote main branch.

```bash
git push origin main
```

## Conclusion

You've now successfully managed multiple branches in Git. This workflow is essential for managing different development streams, fixing issues, and ensuring that your main branch remains stable while new features or changes are being developed. As you become more familiar with branching and merging, you'll find it an invaluable tool in your development toolkit.
