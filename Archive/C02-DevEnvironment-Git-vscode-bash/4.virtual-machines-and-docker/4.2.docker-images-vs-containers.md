# Docker Images vs. Docker Containers

Let's delve into an introduction to Docker images and containers, followed by practical demonstrations of creating a container from an existing image on Docker Hub, along with advanced features like port mapping, network creation, and volume management.

## Docker Images

- **Definition**: Docker images are lightweight, standalone, executable packages that include everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files.
- **Immutability**: They are immutable, meaning once created, they do not change. Modifications are made by creating new images.
- **Layered Architecture**: Docker images use a layered architecture. Each layer represents an instruction in the image's Dockerfile. Layers are cached and reused, making image building faster and more efficient.
- **Docker Hub and Registries**: Images are often stored and shared through Docker registries such as Docker Hub.

## Docker Containers

- **Definition**: A Docker container is a runtime instance of a Docker image. It encapsulates the application and its environment.
- **Isolation**: Containers are isolated from each other and the host system, though they can interact through predefined channels.
- **Ephemeral and Mutable**: Containers can be started, stopped, moved, and deleted. Changes made in a container are not reflected in the image and are lost when the container is deleted unless specifically committed to a new image.
- **Resource Efficiency**: They share the host OS kernel and are lightweight compared to virtual machines.

## Demonstration: Creating a Container from a Docker Hub Image

Let's assume you have Docker installed on your system. We'll use a basic example of creating a container from an existing image, such as `nginx`, a popular web server.

1. **Pull an Image from Docker Hub**

   ```bash
   docker pull nginx
   ```

2. **Create and Run a Container from the Image**

   ```bash
   docker run --name mynginx -d nginx
   ```
 
   This command creates a container named `mynginx` and runs it in detached mode.

## Advanced Docker Features

### Port Mapping

- **Purpose**: Port mapping is used to expose the container's ports to the host, allowing external access.
- **Example**: Mapping port 80 of the container to port 8080 of the host.

   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:80 --name mynginx -d nginx
   ```

### Network Creation

- **Purpose**: Custom networks facilitate better control over container communication.
- **Example**: Creating a new network and attaching a container to it.

   ```bash
   docker network create my_network
   docker run --net=my_network --name mynginx -d nginx
   ```

### Volume Creation and Sharing

- **Purpose**: Volumes are used to persist data and share it between the host and containers.
- **Example**: Creating a volume and sharing a directory with the host.

   ```bash
   docker volume create my_volume
   docker run -v my_volume:/data --name mynginx -d nginx
   ```

   This mounts `my_volume` to `/data` in the container.

These commands demonstrate the flexibility and power of Docker in creating and managing containers with various configurations and requirements, essential for scalable and efficient application deployment.
