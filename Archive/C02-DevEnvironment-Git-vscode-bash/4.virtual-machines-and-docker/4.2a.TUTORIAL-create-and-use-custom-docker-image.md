# Creating and using a Custom Docker image

In this tutorial, we will create and deploy a Docker image that encapsulates a Python environment, a Flask web application, and a pre-trained decision tree model for predictions. This tutorial assumes a basic understanding of Python, Flask, and Docker.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of Python and Flask.
- A pre-trained decision tree model (e.g., a `.pkl` file if you're using scikit-learn).

## Step 1: Setting Up the Flask Application

1. **Create a Project Directory:**
   Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it.

   ```bash
   mkdir flask_decision_tree_app
   cd flask_decision_tree_app
   ```

2. **Python Environment:**
   It's good practice to use a virtual environment, but since we are containerizing the application, this step is optional.

3. **Flask Application:**
   Create a file named `app.py`. This will be your main Flask application.

   ```python
   from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
   import pickle

   app = Flask(__name__)

   # Load your pre-trained model
   model = pickle.load(open('model.pkl', 'rb'))

   @app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
   def predict():
       data = request.get_json()
       prediction = model.predict([data.values()])
       return jsonify(prediction.tolist())

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run(debug=True)
   ```

4. **Requirements File:**

   Create a `requirements.txt` file that lists all the necessary Python packages. For a basic Flask app with a decision tree model, your requirements might look like this:

   ```environment
   Flask==2.0.1
   numpy==1.19.5
   scikit-learn==0.24.2
   ```

5. **Add Your Pre-trained Model:**
   Place your pre-trained decision tree model (e.g., `model.pkl`) in the project directory.

## Step 2: Creating the Dockerfile

1. **Create a Dockerfile:**
   In the root of your project directory, create a file named `Dockerfile` with no file extension.

2. **Specify the Base Image:**
   We'll use an official Python image as our base.

   ```Dockerfile
   FROM python:3.8-slim
   ```

3. **Set the Working Directory:**
   This is where your application will live inside the container.

   ```Dockerfile
   WORKDIR /app
   ```

4. **Copy Files:**
   Copy the `requirements.txt` file and install the Python dependencies.

   ```Dockerfile
   COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
   RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Copy the Rest of the Application:**

   ```Dockerfile
   COPY . .
   ```

6. **Expose the Port:**
   Flask runs on port 5000 by default, so we'll expose it.

   ```Dockerfile
   EXPOSE 5000
   ```

7. **Command to Run the Application:**

   ```Dockerfile
   CMD ["python", "app.py"]
   ```

## Step 3: Building and Running the Docker Container

1. **Build the Docker Image:**
   In your terminal, navigate to the directory containing your Dockerfile and run:

   ```bash
   docker build -t flask_decision_tree_app .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker Container:**

   ```bash
   docker run -p 5000:5000 flask_decision_tree_app
   ```

## Step 4: Testing the Application

- You can test the application by sending a POST request to `http://localhost:5000/predict` with JSON data corresponding to the input features expected by your decision tree model.

## Conclusion

You now have a Dockerized Flask application that uses a pre-trained decision tree model for predictions. This setup encapsulates your Python environment and dependencies, ensuring consistency across different platforms and deployments. It's a practical approach to deploy machine learning models in a web application context.
