# Using existing Docker Images and Docker-Compose

In this tutorial, we will use existing Docker images from Docker Hub (though, these could easily be your own custom images as well), and then demonstrate how to use Docker Compose to set up a more complex environment. We'll use PostgreSQL and pgAdmin as our example.

## Part 1: Using Existing Docker Images

### Step 1: Pulling an Image from Docker Hub

1. **Choose an Image:**
   For this example, let's use the official PostgreSQL image. You can find it on Docker Hub.

2. **Pull the Image:**
   Open your terminal and pull the image using the Docker command:
   
   ```bash
   docker pull postgres
   ```

### Step 2: Running a Container

1. **Run a PostgreSQL Container:**
   To run a PostgreSQL container, use the following command:
   
   ```bash
   docker run --name some-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d postgres
   ```
   
   This command creates a container named `some-postgres` with a specified password. The `-d` flag runs the container in detached mode.

2. **Accessing the Database:**
   You can access the database using any PostgreSQL client with the default user `postgres` and the password you set (`mysecretpassword` in this case).

## Part 2: Using Docker Compose for Multi-Container Setups

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. We'll create a `docker-compose.yml` file to run both PostgreSQL and pgAdmin.

### Step 1: Create a Docker Compose File

1. **Create `docker-compose.yml`:**
   In your project directory, create a file named `docker-compose.yml`.

2. **Define Services:**
   Add the following content to the file:
  
   ```yaml
   version: '3.1'

   services:
     db:
       image: postgres
       restart: always
       environment:
         POSTGRES_PASSWORD: mysecretpassword
       volumes:
         - ./data/db:/var/lib/postgresql/data

     pgadmin:
       image: dpage/pgadmin4
       restart: always
       environment:
         PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL: admin@admin.com
         PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: root
       ports:
         - "5050:80"
       depends_on:
         - db
   ```
  
   This configuration sets up two services:
   - `db`: The PostgreSQL database.
   - `pgadmin`: The pgAdmin web interface.

   We map a local directory (`./data/db`) to the container to persist database data. pgAdmin is accessible on port 5050 of the host machine.

### Step 2: Running Docker Compose

1. **Start Services:**
   In the directory containing your `docker-compose.yml`, run:
  
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Accessing pgAdmin:**
   Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:5050`. Log in using the email and password defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file (admin@admin.com and root).

3. **Connecting to PostgreSQL from pgAdmin:**
   - In pgAdmin, add a new server.
   - In the connection settings, use `db` as the host name (the service name defined in Docker Compose acts as the hostname), `postgres` as the user, and the password you set for PostgreSQL.

## Conclusion

You have successfully pulled and run a PostgreSQL container from Docker Hub and used Docker Compose to create a more complex setup involving PostgreSQL and pgAdmin. Docker Compose is particularly useful for defining and running multi-container Docker applications, making it easier to manage the connections and configurations of multiple services. This approach is highly beneficial in a business analytics and information systems context, where managing multiple interrelated services in a consistent and reproducible manner is crucial.
