1. Create and run your first program
2. * NOTE: To complete this assignment, you will need to have access to the class organization (ISM6562-Big-Data). You will soon receive an invitation to join the organization. If you have not received an invitation by the end of the second class, please contact the class GA.

* go to your workspace folder ```cr ~/Workspace```
* clone your personal repo from the ```ISM6562-Big-Data``` organization (This will look something like ISM6562-Big-Data/STUDENTxx)
* cd into your personal repo folder
* run vscode by entering ```code .```
* On the left had side of your vscode application, right click and select create new folder
* Call the folder what you want, but I'll call it `testing`
* Right click on the left side (folder view) of vscode, and select new file.
* For the filename, enter `my-first-bd-program.ipynb`
* Enter some python code in a python cell (this may not look like it, but VSCode is now acting like a jupyterlab notebook)
  * `print("Hello World!)`
* Run the notebook
  * When you do this, you'll be asked to select the interpreter. In the dropdown list, find 'bd' python environment.
