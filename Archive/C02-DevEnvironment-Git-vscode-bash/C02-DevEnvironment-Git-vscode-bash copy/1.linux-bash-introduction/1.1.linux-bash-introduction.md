## Introduction to Linux

**Linux** is an open-source operating system (OS) modeled after UNIX. It was first released by Linus Torvalds in 1991. The core of Linux is the Linux kernel, which acts as the intermediary between computer hardware and the applications running on the system.

### Key Characteristics of Linux:

1. **Open Source Nature**: Unlike proprietary operating systems like Windows or macOS, Linux is open-source, meaning its source code is freely available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute.

2. **Security and Stability**: Linux is renowned for its robust security and stability. This is partly due to its permission and user role features, and also because it's less targeted by malware compared to more widely-used operating systems.

3. **Customizability**: One of the most compelling features of Linux is its high degree of customizability. Users can choose from multiple distributions (distros) like Ubuntu, Fedora, or Debian, each offering unique features and user experiences.

4. **Community Support**: Being open-source, Linux has a vibrant community of developers and users who contribute to its development, maintenance, and support.

5. **Use in Servers and Supercomputers**: Linux dominates the server market and is the OS of choice for supercomputers due to its stability, scalability, and low cost.

### The Linux Kernel

The core of the Linux system is the Linux kernel which manages system resources like CPU, memory, and peripheral devices. It handles crucial tasks like memory/process management, networking, file systems, device drivers and more. Understanding the modular Linux kernel architecture allows tweaking specific parameters and customizations.

### Linux Distributions

There are many Linux distributions to choose from depending on your need, like:

- Ubuntu - Popular desktop Linux focused on ease of use
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) - Commercial Linux distro for enterprises 
- Debian - Stable distro focused on free open source software 
- Kali Linux - Penetration testing and security auditing Linux distro

### File System Hierarchy

The Linux file system follows the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) with a unified directory structure like:

- /bin - Essential binary files
- /etc - System configuration files
- /home - User home directories
- /usr - Secondary hierarchy for user files
- /var - Variable data like logs and databases

This standardized hierarchy makes it easy to navigate across different Linux distros.

### Linux Philosophy

Understanding Linux design philosophy focused on modular, reusable components that work through collaboration helps leverage its true potential. Powerful bash scripting capabilities allow easily automating tasks across systems.

## Introduction to Terminal/Bash

The Linux terminal provides a command line interface to interact with the OS. Popular Linux shells like Bash and zsh allow composing commands through a Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop (REPL).

### Basic Commands

Essential Linux commands include file/directory operations like `cd`, `pwd`, `ls`; file viewing using `cat`, `less`, `head`, `tail` and editors like `vim` and `nano`; searching within files with `grep`; and discovering system details and process monitoring using commands like `uname`, `df`, `ps`, `top`. Mastering the Linux man pages system provides help on all commands.

### Advanced Features

One can redirect I/O streams, pipe outputs between commands, customize prompts, set aliases for complex command sequences and define handy functions through shell scripting. Backgrounding processes with & frees up the terminal.

### Shell Scripting

Bash scripting allows automating repetitive tasks through conditioned loops, arithmetic operations, command substitutions and custom functions packaged as executable scripts. Advanced scripting techniques include error handling, argument parsing, signal handling, and scheduling cron jobs.

### Customization

Linux terminals are highly customizable with features like:

- Modifying PS1 prompt with colors, command status etc.  
- Defining site-specific alias shortcuts
- Custom keyboard shortcuts
- Installable themes like PowerLevel10k
- Extensions through plugins like zsh-autosuggestions
  
### Conclusion

The Linux OS offers the stability and customizability perfect for running analytics systems and business applications cost-effectively. Mastering the Linux terminal and scripting empowers developers and IT admins to effectively manage systems and automate routine tasks.
