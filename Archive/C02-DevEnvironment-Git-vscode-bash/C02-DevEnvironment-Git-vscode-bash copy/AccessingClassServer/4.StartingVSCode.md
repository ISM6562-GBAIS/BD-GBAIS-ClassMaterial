1. Start vscode in the class repo folder.
  * enter `cd ~/Workspace/bd-s24`

    *  Open terminal
    *  enter `cp -r ~/Workspace/bd-s24 ~/Workspace/bd-personal`
4. Enter the local bd-personal folder and start vscode
    *  Open terminal
    *  enter `cd ~/Workspace/bd-personal`
    *  enter `code .`
