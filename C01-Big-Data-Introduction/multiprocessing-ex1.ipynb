    "The multiprocessing package is a great way to speed up your code. But, if the complexity of the task is not high enough, the overhead of creating the processes will be higher than the speedup you get from parallelization. In this case, the code will actually run slower than the serial version. This overhead is also why the speedup is not linear with the number of cores. The more cores you use, the more overhead you have. This overhead though becomes a smaller percentage of the total time as the complexity of the task increases."
