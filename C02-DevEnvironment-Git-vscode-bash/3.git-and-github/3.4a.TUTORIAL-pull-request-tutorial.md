# Tutorial: Contributing to a Public Repository via Pull Requests

In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of contributing to a public repository on GitHub, specifically a repository named "some-opensource-project". We'll use pull requests, a key feature of GitHub, to propose changes to the project.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account.
- Git installed on your local machine.

## Step 1: Fork the Repository

1. **Navigate to the Repository**: Go to the GitHub page for "some-opensource-project".
2. **Fork the Repository**: Click the "Fork" button at the top right corner of the page. This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

## Step 2: Clone Your Fork

1. **Open Your Terminal**: Access your command line or terminal.
2. **Clone the Forked Repository**: Run the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/some-opensource-project.git
   ```

   Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username.

## Step 3: Create a New Branch

1. **Navigate to the Repository Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd some-opensource-project
   ```

2. **Create and Switch to a New Branch**: It's a best practice to create a new branch for your changes.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b new-feature
   ```

   Replace `new-feature` with a descriptive name for your branch.

## Step 4: Make Your Changes

1. **Edit or Add Files**: Make the necessary changes or additions to the project. You can use your preferred text editor or IDE.

## Step 5: Commit Your Changes

1. **Stage Your Changes**:

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

2. **Commit the Changes**:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add a brief but descriptive comment about your changes"
   ```

## Step 6: Push the Changes to Your Fork

1. **Push the Branch to Your GitHub Fork**:

   ```bash
   git push origin new-feature
   ```

## Step 7: Create a Pull Request

1. **Go to the Original Repository**: Navigate to the original "some-opensource-project" repository on GitHub.
2. **Open a New Pull Request**:
   - You'll often see a prompt to "Compare & pull request" for your newly pushed branch. Click on it.
   - If you don't see the prompt, go to the "Pull requests" tab and click "New pull request". Select your branch.
3. **Create the Pull Request**:
   - Add a title and description for your pull request. Clearly describe the changes you've made and the reason for them.
   - Click "Create pull request".

## Step 8: Respond to Feedback

- **Review and Respond**: Maintainers of the repository might review your pull request and request changes or provide feedback. Be sure to respond to any comments and make any necessary additional changes.

## Step 9: Merge the Pull Request

- **Merging**: If your pull request is approved, the maintainers of "some-opensource-project" will merge your changes into the main project. Sometimes, they might ask you to do it yourself.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully contributed to a public repository using a pull request. This process is fundamental to collaborative work on GitHub, allowing you to contribute to open-source projects and collaborate with developers worldwide. Remember, open-source contribution is not just about code; documentation, bug reports, and feature suggestions are equally valuable.
