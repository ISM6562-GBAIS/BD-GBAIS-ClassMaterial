  * enter `git config --global  user.name "your full name"`

    * Select the button `Generate New Token`
    * In the dropdown list, select `Generate New Token (classic)`
    * Enter the name for this token (something like BigData, but you can call it what you want)
    * Set the expiry date to `No Expiration`
    * Select the checkbox next to `repo` (this will result in all checkboxes in the repo section being checked)
    * Scroll to the bottom of the page and select `Generate Token`
    * Copy the long string of alpha-numeric characters that is your token.
  * Update your local repo folder with the latest class material
    * Open terminal
    * enter `git config --global credential.helper store`
