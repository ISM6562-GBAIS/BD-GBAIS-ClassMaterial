# Linux Command Line Interface

Let's delve into a tutorial covering the basics of Linux Bash, including the default directory structure, basic commands, file permissions, and ownership. This tutorial is designed to provide a foundational understanding for those new to Linux and its command-line interface.

> [!NOTE]
> When computers first appeared in business, they were centralized. We didn't have a computer on every desk, but rather, we had a central computer that we accessed using a specialized hardware device called a console. These consoles presented a terminal program (and that's all they did) that allowed the user to 'talk to' the main computer. The main computer would need to have some default software that is the program that the use interacts with to do things like copy files, run programs, etc. This program was known as a shell. NOW-A-DAYs, things are very different, but we still see terms like terminal, console, and shell being used. These terms, though having slightly different connotations, can generally be considered synonymous in their use today. Another term that can be considered synonymous to these other three is "CLI" (command line interface).

## Filesystem Navigation

The Linux filesystem has a standard hierarchy with `/` at the top. Navigating it forms the basis for many admin tasks.

**Useful Navigation Commands:**
- `pwd` - Print working directory 
- `ls` - List folder contents
- `cd` - Change directory
- `tree` - Display directory tree structure
- `du` - Disk usage statistics
- `df` - Filesystem disk space usage

**Path Resolution:**

Paths can be either absolute (from `/` root) or relative (to current directory). Some special paths are:
- `.` - Current directory
- `..` - Parent directory 
- `~` - Home directory of current user
- `/home/username` - Home folder of user 'username'

**Examples:**
```
cd /etc    # Changes to /etc folder from anywhere
cd ../logs # Moves one level up and into logs folder
cd         # Changes to home folder
cd -       # Returns to previous folder
```
Creating, modifying, searching, and organizing files and folders make up key admin tasks.

**Useful File Management Commands:**

- `cd` - Change directory
- `echo` - Print to standard output
- `>` - Redirect output to a file  
- `>>` - Append redirect output 
- `mv` - Move/rename files and folders
- `cp` - Copy files and folders 
- `rm` - Delete files and folders
- `rmdir` - Remove empty directories
- `cat` - View file contents
  - `less` - View file contents interactively
  - `head/tail` - View start/end of file
- `ls` - List directory contents
  - `grep` - Search for patterns within files
  - `find` - Search for files and directories
- `man` - Access manual pages
- `whatis` - Display one-line manual page description
- `whoami` - Print current user
- `chmod` - Change file permissions

**Examples:**

```
echo "text" > file.txt   # Create new file with content
echo "add this" >> file.txt # Append text to existing file 

grep error /var/log/syslog # Search syslog file for 'error' pattern

mkdir reports     # Create new folder
mv file.txt reports/  # Move file into folder
cp -r reports reports_backup # Recursively copy folder 
```

## Understanding Shell Command Structure

Linux shell commands generally follow a common structure and provide built-in help for learning usage. 

**Command Structure**

```zsh
command [options] [arguments]
```

- `command` - The name of the command 
- `options` (also called `flags` or `switches`) - Start with `-` or `--`, modify the behavior of the command
- `arguments` - What the command acts on

**Getting Help**

- `command --help` - Provide usage info for a command
- `man command` - Access the manual page for a command 
- `whatis command` - Brief description of a command

**Examples** 

```zsh
ls -l /home # -l is an option to enable long listing format

grep --ignore-case "error" /var/log/syslog # --ignore-case is a flag, short form is -i

mkdir -p test/subfolder # -p creates parent folders if needed

man ls # Access ls manual page

whatis df # Prints short df description
```

## Permissions and Ownership

Managing Linux permissions and ownership is important for security and access control. 

**Key Concepts**

- Read (r), Write(w) and Execute(x) permissions 
- File owner and group permissions
- Numeric representation of rwx permissions

**Useful Commands**

- `ls -l` - View permissions and ownership
- `chmod` - Modify permissions  
- `chown` - Change file owner
- `chgrp` - Change file group

**Examples:**

```zsh
chmod 600 file.txt # rw for owner
chmod 755 foldername # rwx for owner, rx for group and others 

chown user1 file.txt # Change owner to user1
chgrp finance foldername # Change group to finance
```

**Other Advanced Concepts:** Special permissions like setuid, setgid; Default umask; ACLs for finer control.

## Combining Commands

The true power of the Linux shell lies in combining various commands and IO redirection to build customized workflows.

**Common Patterns** 

- Output of one command as input for another using pipes (`|`)  
- Combining multiple commands using conditional execution operators `&&` and `||`
- Running commands in subshell using parantheses (`()`)

**Example Scenarios**

1. Create a folder if it doesn't exist already  
   `[[ -d reports ]] || mkdir reports`

2. Redirect both stdout and stderr to a log file
   `scriptname >log 2>&1`

3. Search the syslog for "error" and save matching lines to errors.log
   `grep error /var/log/syslog > errors.log`

## Conclusion

Through combining Linux commands, one can automate complex workflows and build robust system administration scripts tailored to specific business use cases.
