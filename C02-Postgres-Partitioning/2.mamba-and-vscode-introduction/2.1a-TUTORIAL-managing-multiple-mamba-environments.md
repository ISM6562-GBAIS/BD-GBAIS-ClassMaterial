# Managing multiple Mamba/Conda environments.

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of creating two separate JupyterLab environments using Mamba or Conda. These environments will be named `bdlab310` and `bdlab312`, each using different versions of Python: 3.10 and 3.12, respectively. This approach is particularly useful in an academic setting, allowing you to explore and demonstrate different Python features or libraries in isolated environments.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure that Conda or Mamba is installed on your system. If not, you can install Miniforge from [here](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) or install Mamba using Conda (NOTE: Mamba is installed in the big data virtual machine available to you on Cyberhub)

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Creating the `bdlab310` Environment

1. **Open Terminal**: Launch your terminal application.

2. **Create the Environment**: Run the following command to create an environment named `bdlab310` with Python 3.10:

```bash
   mamba create -n bdab310 python=3.10
```

   If you're using Conda, replace `mamba` with `conda` in the command.

3. **Activate the Environment**: Activate the new environment by running:

```bash
   conda activate bdlab310
```

4. **Install JupyterLab**: Within the activated environment, install JupyterLab:

```bash
   mamba install jupyterlab
```

   Again, if using Conda, replace `mamba` with `conda`.

5. **Launch JupyterLab**: Once installed, start JupyterLab:

```bash
   jupyter lab
```

   This will open JupyterLab in your default web browser.

### Creating the `bdlab312` Environment

Repeat the steps above for the second environment, this time using Python 3.12:

1. **Create the Environment**:

```bash
   mamba create -n bdlab312 python=3.12
```

2. **Activate the Environment**:

```bash
   conda activate bdlab312
```

3. **Install JupyterLab**:

```bash
   mamba install jupyterlab
```

4. **Launch JupyterLab**:

```bash
   jupyter lab
```

## Switching Between Environments

To switch between these JupyterLab environments, you simply need to activate the desired environment and launch JupyterLab. For example, to switch back to `bdlab310`:

1. Close the current JupyterLab session (if open).
2. In the terminal, deactivate the current environment:

```bash
   conda deactivate
```

3. Activate the other environment:

```bash
   conda activate bdlab310
```

4. Launch JupyterLab:

```bash
   jupyter lab
```

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you have successfully created two isolated JupyterLab environments with different Python versions. There are many benefits of isolating major projects into their own conda environment, such as:

- What you write will work, even if you've updated or deleted package in other projects.
- Module/package conflicts, though rare, can be a problem. By isolating into seperate environments, this problem is reduced or eliminated.
