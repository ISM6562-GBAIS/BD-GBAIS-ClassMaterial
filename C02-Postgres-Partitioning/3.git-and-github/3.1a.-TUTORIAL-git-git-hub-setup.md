# Git and GitHub Tutorial: From Repository Creation to Pushing Changes

In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of creating a GitHub repository, cloning it to your local machine, making changes, and pushing these changes back to GitHub. We'll also cover the initial setup for Git, including configuring your username, email, and enabling credential storage.

## Initial Setup

Before you start using Git and GitHub, you need to set up your Git environment.

### 1. Install Git

First, ensure that Git is installed on your machine. You can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

### 2. Configure Git

Open your terminal and configure your Git username and email. These will be associated with your commits.

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
```

### 3. Enable Credential Storage

To avoid entering your username and password every time you interact with GitHub, you can use Git's credential storage.

```bash
git config --global credential.helper store
# For Windows users, replace 'store' with 'manager'
```

## Creating a GitHub Repository

### 1. Create a New Repository

- Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in.
- Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository."
- Name your repository, add a description (optional), and choose whether it should be public or private.
- Click "Create repository."

## Cloning the Repository to Your Local Machine

### 1. Clone the Repository

- On your repository's page on GitHub, click the "Code" button and copy the URL under "Clone with HTTPS."
- Open your terminal and run:

  ```bash
  git clone [URL]
  ```

  Replace `[URL]` with the URL you copied.

### 2. Navigate into Your Repository

Change your current working directory to the repository you just cloned.

```bash
cd [repository-name]
```

## Making Changes to the Repository

### 1. Create or Edit Files

Make changes to your project using your preferred text editor or IDE.

### 2. Stage the Changes

Once you've made changes, you need to stage them. This prepares the changes to be committed.

```bash
git add .
# The '.' adds all the changed files to the staging area
```

### 3. Commit the Changes

Commit your staged changes, along with a descriptive message.

```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

## Pushing Changes to GitHub

### 1. Push the Changes

Finally, push your committed changes to GitHub.

> [!NOTE]
> Originally, the default main brach of a repository was called `master`. Though you can call you main channel any name you want, the new norm is to call it `main`. Therefore, when you see the term `master` used for the default repo, keep in  mind that `main` is the new preferred name.
> 
```bash
git push origin main
# 'main' is the branch name. Replace it with your branch name if different.
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully created a GitHub repository, cloned it to your local machine, made changes, and pushed these changes back to GitHub. This workflow is fundamental to using Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration. As you become more comfortable with these tools, you'll discover more advanced features and workflows that can enhance your development process.
