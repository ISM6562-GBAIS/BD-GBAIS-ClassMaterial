# Git Tutorial: Handling a Merge Conflict

In this tutorial, we'll follow a similar workflow to the previous one but intentionally create a merge conflict between the `main` and `development` branches. We'll then resolve this conflict using Visual Studio Code (VSCode) as the editor. Additionally, I'll show you how to set VSCode as the default editor for merge conflicts.

## Prerequisites

- Git installed on your machine.
- A local Git repository.
- Visual Studio Code installed.

## Step 1: Setting VSCode as the Default Editor for Merge Conflicts

Before we start, let's set VSCode as the default editor for Git. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
git config --global merge.tool vscode
git config --global mergetool.vscode.cmd 'code --wait $MERGED'
```

## Step 2: Creating a Development Branch

1. **Check Your Current Branch**

   ```bash
   git branch
   ```

2. **Create and Switch to the Development Branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b development
   ```

## Step 3: Making Commits to the Development Branch

1. **Make Changes in the Development Branch**
   - Edit or add files.
2. **Stage and Commit Changes**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Changes in development branch"
   ```

## Step 4: Creating a Conflict

1. **Switch to the Main Branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

2. **Make Conflicting Changes in the Main Branch**
   - Edit the same files you edited in the `development` branch but with different changes.

3. **Stage and Commit the Conflicting Changes**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Conflicting changes in main branch"
   ```

## Step 5: Merging and Encountering a Conflict

1. **Switch Back to the Development Branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout development
   ```

2. **Merge Main into Development**

   ```bash
   git merge main
   ```

   This will result in a merge conflict because the same files were edited differently on both branches.

## Step 6: Resolving the Merge Conflict with VSCode

1. **Open VSCode to Resolve Conflicts**
   - Git will mark the file(s) with conflicts. Open these files in VSCode.
2. **Resolve Conflicts**
   - VSCode shows the conflicting changes from both branches. Choose which changes to keep or edit the file to resolve the conflict.
3. **Save and Close the File**
   - After resolving the conflicts, save and close the file.

## Step 7: Finalizing the Merge

1. **Mark Conflicts as Resolved**

   ```bash
   git add [conflicted_file]
   ```

   Replace `[conflicted_file]` with the name of the file you resolved.

2. **Complete the Merge**

   ```bash
   git commit
   ```

   Git will open a commit message file in your default editor. Save and close it to complete the merge.

## Step 8: Pushing Changes (Optional)

If you're working with a remote repository, push your changes to update it.

```bash
git push origin development
```

## Conclusion

You've successfully created and resolved a merge conflict using Git and Visual Studio Code. Handling merge conflicts is a common part of working with version control systems, especially in collaborative environments. By understanding how to resolve these conflicts, you can maintain a smooth workflow and ensure that your codebase remains consistent and error-free.
