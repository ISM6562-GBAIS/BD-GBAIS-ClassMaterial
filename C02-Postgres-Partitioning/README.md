# C02 Partitioning and Sharding

The primary goal of partitioning and sharding in databases is to improve performance and scalability. By distributing data across multiple servers or disks, these techniques can help manage large datasets more efficiently.

In this class we will cover Partitioning and Sharding. We will also review, and expand our understanding of tools such as Shell/Terminal, Git, and GitHub (first introduced last class). We will also introduce the concept of Docker and how it can be used to manage and deploy applications.

There is more material in this folder than can be covered in a single class. The material is organized in a way that allows you to explore topics of interest in more depth. Some of this material is optional - and provided for more advanced students looking for a deeper understanding of the topics.

What is required to know is the following:

* Work with shell
  * `cd`, `ls`, `rm`, `rmdir`, `mkdir`, `cp`, `mv`, `echo`, `cat`, and redirection ( `>`, `>>` )
* Work with Git and GitHub
  * `git clone`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git pull`, and `git status`
  * Create a repository on GitHub and clone it to your local machine
  * Make changes to the repository and push them back to GitHub
* Work with docker
  * docker compose up, and stop
  * basic understanding of a docker compose YAML file. 
* Partitioning and Sharding
  * Understand the concepts of partitioning and sharding
  * Understand the benefits and challenges of partitioning and sharding
  * Understand how partitioning and sharding can be implemented in PostgreSQL
