# Cloudera Docker Container

Make sure you have a folder named persistent-storage created inside the Docker/Cloudera folder (the folder this README.md is in)

Run docker-compose up. Once you see 'impala', then the cloudera system is loaded (impala is the last service to be loaded).

Once cloudera is running, you can login into hue (localhost:8888). Username is cloudera, and password is cloudera.
