# Docker Compose Files

To run these containers, you must have Docker Desktop installed. You computer must also have a minimum Specification of 4GB of memory.

Each of the docker compose folders has SMALL, MEDIUM and LARGE in the name. For the best performance, choose the largest you can based on your computer specifications.
- Choose SMALL for computers with 4GB of mememory
- Choose MEDIUM for computers with 8GB of memory
- Choose LARGE for computers with 12GB of memory
- Choose X-LARGE for computers with 16+GB of memory

To help save on memory, only run one cluster at a time. For instance, if you are only working on a Postgres CLuster, then make sure all other clusters are stopped. You can do this by using Docker Desktop. 

NOTE: If you computer does not meet the minimum specifications, you will need to use the CyberHub VM. Details about using the CyberHub VM will be provided in Class3 (March, 30th).
