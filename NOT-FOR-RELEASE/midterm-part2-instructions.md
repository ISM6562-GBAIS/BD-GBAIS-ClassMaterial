Dear Student,

Your task is to create a partitioned table in PostgreSQL using LIST partitioning. The details are as follows:


- Table Name: river_stone
- Fields: id, name, score
- Partition Key: id


You must partition the table into 3 partitions and also set up a default partition. 


NOTE: It doesn't matter how many rows would be in each partition, you simply need to demonstrate that you can use LIST partitioning syntax and SQL syntax for creating a partitioned table.


Submit your SQL script to both canvas and as a push to your repo BEFORE the deadline. NOTE: If both are not submitted before the deadline, you get zero. If one is missing, you get 50 percent of your mark. If you submit both (as instructed) you can get up to 100 percent of your mark if your SQL is correct. 


NOTE: If you know the material, you have plenty of time to complete part 2. It is your responsibility to give yourself enough time to resolve any issues you may have with github or canvas. Having the skills necessary to accomplish this is part of this question/task.


Best,
Dr. Smith
